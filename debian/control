Description: Log Watcher Daemon (logwatcherd)
 The objective of the Log Watcher Daemon (logwatcherd) is to provide a simple and
 modular way to watch logs for specific events and take appropriate actions.
 .
 It consists of a Python daemon that spawns multiple "watcher" threads, defined
 in a single configuration file.
 .
 Each watcher consists of:
  - one "Producer", which generates data that may be of interest;
    e.g. watching the content of a log file
  - zero-to-many "Filter(s)", which extract meaningful data from the producer;
    e.g. looking for failed login attempts
  - zero-to-many "Conditioner(s)", which further filter or modify the data;
    e.g. excluding IP addresses from the LAN
  - one-to-many "Consumer(s)", which take actions based on that data;
    e.g. add an IP address to an iptables blacklist
 .
 Producers, filters, conditioners and consumers are all plugins. A set of basic
 plugins are provided as part of the Log Watcher Daemon codebase:
 .
 Producer plugins:
  - "Read": dump the content of a given file (cat ...)
  - "Tail": watch content being added to a given file (tail -F ...)
 .
 Filter plugins:
  - "Grep": match data based on a given regular expression
  - "Awk": match data field based on a given regular expression
 .
 Conditioner plugins:
  - "Sed": match (and replace) data based on a given regular expression
 .
 Consumer plugins:
  - "Write": write or append data to a given file
  - "Mail": send data to a given e-mail recipient
  - "Syslog": log data to a given syslog facility
 .
 Plugins are very easy and straight-forward to write and integrate with the Log
 Watcher Daemon, thus allowing users to address even the most exotic use cases.
 .
 With ad-hoc watchers, the Log Watcher Dameon can be made a simple Intrusion
 Detection System. Coupled with dynamic firewall configuration (e.g. along
 iptables 'recent' module), it can become a simple Intrusion Prevention System.
 .
 On the other hand, the Log Watcher Daemon is not about performances and allowing
 to monitor a 10gb/s network link on a core routing host. Its goal is being
 lightweight and simple, and its purpose is being distributed on each host that
 provides some service (e.g. a virtual machine providing SSH remote access).
